# 🧨 Minesweeper - Chrome Extension

Hi!  
This is a simple Minesweeper game I made as a Chrome extension. I built it because I wanted a quick, clean version of Minesweeper that you can play right in your browser, without ads or distractions.

## 🔧 What I used

I made the game using:
- **HTML** — for the structure of the popup
- **CSS** — for styling (manually adapted to look clean in a small window)
- **JavaScript** — for the game logic (mines, flags, timer, etc.)

I also made it work as a **popup** inside Chrome using the `manifest.json` and a couple of basic browser extension APIs.

## 🎮 Features

- Classic Minesweeper gameplay
- Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty levels
- Timer and mine counter
- Works fully offline
- Lightweight and fast
